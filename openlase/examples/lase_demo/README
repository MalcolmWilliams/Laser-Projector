Yes, this is the source code for LASE. Keep in mind that a good chunk of this
was coded in a rush at the party, and it's also basically the first nontrivial
code written for openlase. It has been modified slightly to make it work with
the current API (which was slightly incompatible) but otherwise remains
untouched, although it will look slightly better due to libol improvements
since the demo was made.

Danger: Here be dragons. :-)

To compile: I've been too lazy to add a CMake module to conditionally search
for libmodplug, so this is disabled by default. Uncomment the subdir at the end
of ../CMakeLists.txt and make sure you have libmodplug and its headers (-dev
package) installed.

To run: make sure that GLOS-pope.xm is in your $PWD before running the binary
(e.g. run it from this directory).
