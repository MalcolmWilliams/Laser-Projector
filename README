Laser-Projector

will need to install venv
pip install virtualenv --user
or
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
then activate venv before working on the project. 
```source venv/bin/activate```
venv makes managing the python dependancies much easier. 
flask offers a good explanation of venv here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/installation/

for twitter API follow the instructions here:

Note: this for reference because I should be including all the compiled files in the project. 

Lasershark protocol:
r=1000 # THIS MUST BE THE FIRST LINE IN THE FILE!
The "r=number" command sets the speed in points per second (pps) at which samples are displayed by the Lasershark. 
The pps speed can be set to any integer between 1 and the maximum value as reported by the Lasershark (64000)   
You should not set this value to be greater than what your galvos are capable of operating at.
Failure to adhere to this guidance can result in galvo damage or decreased lifespan.

e=1 
The "e=" command sets the output enable state of the Lasershark. The output enable status must be set for any
laser or galvo control to occur.
"e=1" == enable
"e=0" == disable

p=Prints a text string to the console

s=1,1,1,1,1,1 
The "s=" command adds a sample to the sample buffer to be written out to the Lasershark.
A sample defines galvo positioning and laser intensity for a particular point to be displayed. 
The format is "s=X,Y,A,B,C,INTL_A"
The ranges for these fields are X=[0-4095],Y=[0-4095],A=[0-4095],B=[0-4095],C=[0,1],INTL_A=[0,1]
For A and B (analog laser control outputs), 0 means the output is off and 4096 means the output is at full power
1024 would indicate 25% output power, 2048 would indicate 50% output power, etc.
For C (TTL laser control output) 0 means the output is off and 1 means the output is on
For INTL_A (Interlock A) 0 means the output is off and 1 means the output is on (for ttl)
Samples are queued until they fill a full lasershark packet and are then written out to the lasershark.
This means that to ensure ALL samples are written out, a flush should be performed once all desired samples are 
written out.

f=1
Flushes all samples. It is reccomended to stick this at the end of your output file to ensure all samples are displayed.
